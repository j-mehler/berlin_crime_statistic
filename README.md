### Abstract

This article examines the development of crime rates in Berlin. More specifically, it distinguishes between the first year before the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and the first year after the outbreak. Hence, potential changes in criminal activity are made visible. Furthermore, this article does not only consider the total number of crimes but rather differentiates between sub-categories. Subsequently, different developments across crime types can be examined. For this purpose, the Police Crime Statistic [(Kriminalitätsatlas Berlin)](https://www.kriminalitaetsatlas.berlin.de/K-Atlas/bezirke/atlasbez.html) is considered. As a main result, this investigation finds that the overall crime numbers slightly decreased in the examined time period. However, a closer look at the different crime types and city districts illustrates that this downward trend is driven by fundamentally contrasting developments within the respective categories. Exemplarily, some categories as car theft experienced drastically declining numbers, while drug-related offences increased in large parts of Berlin.
